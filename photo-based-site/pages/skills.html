        <h2>Customer Service Skills </h2>
        <p>I worked in a Caseyâ€™s for 6 months and quickly picked up the skills required for me to interact with customers. Seeing a wide array of people has allowed me to adjust my behavior to the attitude of clients. </p>
        <h2>Bilingual</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a mixed community and learned how to converse both in English and in Spanish. This skill has proved to be useful in my time working in retail. </p>
        <h2>Teamwork</h2>
        <p>I quickly find a place in a team and actively try to foster a positive workspace environment among my peers. Through my actions in the workplace, I look to carry out my responsibilities in the workplace so my peers can do theirs. </p>
