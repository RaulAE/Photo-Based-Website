        <h2>Casey's</h2>
        <p>After my high school graduation, I worked at a local gas station chain called Casey’s. At Casey’s, I worked mainly as a cashier and carried out various tasks focusing on the sales floor.  These tasks include attending to customers, organizing stock, restocking cigarettes, cleaning the floors, cleaning the bathrooms and taking out the outside trash. </p>
        <p>Aside from working as a cashier I also worked as a part of the truck crew where I stocked the shelves and fridges of the store. This position required me to lift boxes and organize the materials in them in both a presentable manner and a prompt manner.</p>
