        <h2>Harvard High School</h2>
        <p>I attended Harvard High School throughout my teenage years and graduated in the year 2021. From the classes there I learned what was needed from me in addition to some classes that I took out of personal interest. My high school experience was interrupted by covid-19 however and I had to complete the rest of my classes via online learning or mixed learning. While I did not appreciate this at the time I learned how to work on a mixed schedule, and I believe that that practice has proved useful to me as I continue my education farther. </p>
